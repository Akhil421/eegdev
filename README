                               EEGDEV



Presentation
============

eegdev is a library that provides an interface for accessing various EEG
(and other biosignals) acquisition systems in a unified way. The interface
has been designed in order to be both flexible and efficient. The device
specific part is implemented by the means of plugins which makes adding
new device backend fairly easy even if the library does not support them yet
officially.

The core library not only provides a unified and consistent interfaces to
the eegdev users but it also provides many functionalities to the
device backends (plugins) ranging from configuration to data casting and
scaling making writing new device backend an easy task.


Supported devices
=================

As of now, the library support the following backend:

 - Biosemi ActiveTwo
 - gTec gUSBamp
 - reading biosignal data file
 - Tobi network Interface A


Supported platforms
===================

This depends on which device the library should support. The core library
supports any POSIX platform and Windows. All device backend are supported on
these platforms excepting from the gTec gUSBamp device which is, as of now, 
supported only on Linux i386/amd64 platforms.


Compilation
===========

This library is organized as a GNU package and can be compiled and
installed in the same way (see INSTALL file for further information).

In addition to the standard options, the configure script recognize flags
to enable or disable the support for the different backends. By default,
most of the backend are built in if the required libraries are found.

Finally, if only the compilation of one or several plugin is wanted, the
compilation of the core library can be controlled by the configure option:

  --enable-corelib-build[=yes|no] : enable the compilation of the
                    eegdev core library. (yes by default)


USB devices on Linux
====================

On linux (maybe on other platforms as well), usual users cannot access
directly to usb devices. A rules for udev is shipped in the package to
make any connected USB device accessible to users belonging to the plugdev
group. To install this rule file after, just type (after configure) with
root permission:
	make install-usb-plugdev

To uninstall this files, again with root permission:
	make uninstall-usb-plugdev
