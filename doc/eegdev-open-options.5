.SH NAME
eegdev-open-options - Device configuration format specification
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The device configuration string should follow the syntax:
.LP
.ce
device[[|option1|value1]...[|optionN|valueN]]
.LP
If the specified device does not support a certain pair of option|value,
this will be silently ignored by the opening function.
.SS "Recognised devices"
Default value of the supported options are specified within parenthesis:
.TP
.B biosemi
Opens a Biosemi ActiveTwo system. Supports \fBnumch\fP(64) option.
.TP
.B gtec
Opens a gTec gUSBamp system. Supports \fBsamplerate\fP(512),
\fBlowpass\fP(0.1), \fBhighpass\fP(0.4*samplerate), \fBnotch\fP(50),
\fBslave\fP(0)
.TP
.B neurosky
Opens a neurosky system. Supports \fBpath\fP(/dev/rfcomm0) option 
.TP
.B datafile
Opens a fake EEG system that streams data from a data file. Supports
\fBpath\fP(test.bdf) option
.TP
.B any
Opens the first connected device whose type is one of the following
(in the order): \fBbiosemi\fP, \fBgtec\fP, \fBdatafile\fP
.LP
.SS "Recognised options"
Here the list of options recognised by the library and their explanation:
.TP
.B path
Specifies the path to the device that should be used.
.TP
.B numch
Number of channel that should be supported by the BIOSEMI system. Accepted
values are \fB32\fP, \fB64\fP, \fB128\fP or \fB256\fP. Beware that the value
can be set superior to the actual number of ADC subsystem embedded into the
acquisition hardware. If it is the case, the additional channel will return
always 0.
.TP
.B samplerate
Desired sampling frequency used to acquire the data
.TP
.B lowpass
Cutoff frequency of the desired lowpass used by the system. \fB0\fP or
\fBnone\fP means no lowpass filter at all.
.TP
.B highpass
Cutoff frequency of the desired highpass used by the system. \fB0\fP or
\fBnone\fP means no highpass filter at all.
.TP
.B notch
Central frequency of the desired notch filter used by the system. \fB0\fP or
\fBnone\fP means no notch filter at all.
.TP
.B slave
Indicates whether the system should synchronised its sampling clock with a 
master system by wire. \fB0\fP means that the system is autnomous, \fB1\fP
that the system should be in slave mode.
