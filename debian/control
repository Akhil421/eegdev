Description: Library to acquire data from various EEG recording devices
 eegdev is a library that provides a unified interface for accessing an EEG
 recording system (the development targets mainly Biosemi and g.Tec system)
 and can be used as well to playback data in the software stack. In
 addition, it helps the implemention of new drivers by sharing part of code
 common to all drivers.
